# README

This repo is for experimenting with the basic layout of a Python project.

Having a folder structure that enables easy testing with Pytest, and problem-free imports from within the main program code, can be a bit of a hassle, but this layout seems to do the trick.
This repo uses the layout sketched in [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/16985066/1623829) Stackoverflow answer.

Updates will likely follow.
